    <!-- What it does -->
    <h2>Why I built this?</h2>
    <p>I tried one of the popular well funded 'app builder' tools and I wondered how hard is it to actually make one. Here.now had just been released so I thought of building one with Claude API as the backend and Here.now as the hosting provider.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I didnt expect this to work. The first version built on Claude chat (yep, not Claude code) looked ridiculously promising for me to pursue.</p>

    </div>

    <p>I didnt really give this project much thought in terms of design, but I attempted to mimic Plan mode by adding a short intro wizard which would help narrow down what you want to build. This approach would be useful for new folks who have no prior experience building on the internet.</p>

    <!-- How deployment works -->
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Here's what actually happens when you click Deploy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your browser sends the generated HTML to the Smithy server</li>
      <li>The server makes a simple API call to <a href="https://here.now">here.now</a> (a free hosting service) to reserve a URL</li>
      <li>The server uploads your HTML file to that URL</li>
      <li>The server tells here.now "all done, make it live"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it. Three HTTP requests.</p>


    <!-- What I learned -->
    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>It's funny, but the very first version that Claude came up with was 'Dark IDE aesthetic with Neon colors', it shows the bias in the system of existing app builders. I don't think developers are their true target audiences but somehow they still seem to retain the aesthetic. So I asked it to make the style inviting for teenagers and it instantly over-indexed on making it pink and unicorny. I finally got it to reach a warm color scheme which you see in the video.</li>

    <li>Each generation using Claude APi cost me about 20-30 cents. That made me realize that there's a fair amount of margin that these app builder tools are playing with, thus justifying their large funding valuations. But honestly nothing beats working with a base model like Claude or Codex. It's far superior and far cheaper.</li>
  </ul>

     <!-- The stack -->
    <h2>The stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: React with Vite</li>
      <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Express (Node.js)</li>
      <li><strong>AI</strong>: Claude API via Anthropic's SDK — used only for generating the site code</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting</strong>: <a href="https://here.now">here.now</a> — used for deploying the finished sites</li>
      <li><strong>Storage</strong>: localStorage for now (project history, chat threads)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The whole thing runs as two processes — a Vite dev server for the frontend and an Express server that handles the Claude API calls and deployment.</p>
